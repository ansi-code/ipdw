InterPlanetary Data Wallet (IPDW): store your personal or users data within a safe distributed storage. It enables to build a real decentralised network (Web 4.0) without the need to be online. P2P interactions, Database-less backends, verified identities, and much more...

Everyone have a key pair, that means that there are a public key and a private key, that can be saved in different formats (see the BIP39 standard for mnemonic phrases based deterministic key generation).
In Web 3.0 applications can recognise your wallet address (derived from the public key) to let you act on the distributed ledger (the storage) as a well-identified identity.
The blockchains have different replicated and redundant ledger and different consensus algorithms. There is a competition rush to find the best algorithm to achieve it, increase throughput, security and so on...
Let remove the term "blockchain" from the equation, Web 3.0 users are familiar with Private Key usage and management because of applications like Metamask/Trust. These ones simplified a lot the User Experience and right now managing keys and signing a message using RSA is an easy game. 
Thanks to these applications now users are able to do things that in past were done only by expert users like using GPG messaging systems. Remember "adoption" is the key for the evolution. Poor UX/UI means poor adoption.
Why we are talking about these in-famous private keys and public keys?
As we know today nothing except a super quantum computer (reliable in matter of years since the time I'm writing this) can defeat/brute force this wonderful thing. They are only vulnerable to social/phishing and similar attacks. One rule to remember: "Humans every time are the vulnerable elements in the chain".
Using thins assertion we can recreate a lot of computer science related things, now that users are familiar with using them.
Surely you have a physical wallet in your bag or pocket, it is offline and only during a transaction it is eye-visible to the other peer.
Now let's introduce the InterPlanetary Data Wallet as a sophisticated mechanism to store all kind of data, that can works offline and only duringa a transaction it can be partially exposed.
No worries, it is offline but it can be synced between all your devices using some P2P communication strategies like IPFS and IPNS. Yes, it is encrypted, so it is safe to share it without knowing the passphrase.
